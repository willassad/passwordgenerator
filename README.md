# passwordgenerator
Generate secure passwords and save them to a file.
You will need to download this repository to a folder on your computer.
You will now be able to open and run the passwordgen.py file and have access to your database of passwords.
You can add and view passwords through the passwordgen.py file.

When running, in some environments an error "Password input may be echoed" will pop up. This is not to worry.
When running in the terminal this error will not occur. Message me at willassadcode@gmail.com if you have any questions.
